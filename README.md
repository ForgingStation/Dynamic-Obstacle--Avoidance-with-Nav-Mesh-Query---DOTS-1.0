# Dynamic-Obstacle-Avoidance-with-Nav-Mesh-Query---DOTS-1.0
Source code for the video - https://youtu.be/EhwmQZzc8ns

Hey everyone. Coming back after a while now! In this video, I have upgraded the most requested, Navmesh query-based pathfinding to the DOTS 1.0 version. 
That's not all! The new system is more modular, with a spawner that can be reused and dynamic obstacle avoidance. 

It's not perfect and robust as it really depends on the level and enhancement specific to the level where such dynamic behavior is needed. At the least, this should help one understand how to utilize the navmesh query-based ray cast to determine path validity

Note that this is still highly experimental and must not be used in productive environments!
